- Tier  (1-tier, 2-tier, N-tiers)
- Client-Server Mode, REST API
- Scalability (vertical horizontal)
- High Availability ( fault tolerance (micro service), redundancy(active-passible model) replication( active-active model) )
- Load Balancing
    - DNS load  balancer (domain name system —> IP address)
    - Hardware load balancer (expensive)
    - software load balancer (take account the server's compute and traffic ability:  e.g  CPU and memory utilization)
- Monolithic Architecture  and Microservices (back end)
    - Monolith
        - simple, single codebase
        - single point failure, not good for scaling (large traffic), hard to use different technologies
    - Microservices
        - scalable
        - different technologies, continue development
        - no single point failure, fault isolation
- Micro Front ends  (work together with microservices)
- Data base
    - Relational data base (SQL): relationships; data consistency; ACID transactions
    - Non-relational data base (NoSQL): scalability; a lot of read-write; eventually-consistent
    - NoSQL : graph database, key-value database, time series data base, document-oriented database
    - CAP theorem: strong consistency vs high availability
- Caching
    - caching can be in several places in the architecture
    - caching strategy:
        - cache aside , (just cache some data from database, for read-heavy tasks, data **may not be consistent** (since we may write data later after cache loaded))
        - read through cache  (same as cahce aside but data consistent)
        - write-through cache (cache aside and updata cache and databsed: for write-heavy task)
        - write-back cache (only update cache for the moment, update database later, may loose data if clear cache before update database)
- Message Ques
    - publish-subscribe model
    - one-to-one model
    - Push / Pull for messages
- Streaming process (data )
    - data pipeline:  collection+preparation —> process  —> analysis —> visualize —> store
    - batch processing ;  real-time processing
    - distributed data process  Apache Zoomkeeper
    - several software for processing data
        - Apache Hadoop  (batch process)
        - Spark; KafKa (real-time proces)
    - Two architectures
        - Lambda :  (batch )+(real-time) —> serving layer
        - Kappa:   (batch, real-time) —> serving
- P2P architecture (Peer to peer; decentralized )
    - secure (no central control)
    - high availability , automatically scale ( no single failure)
